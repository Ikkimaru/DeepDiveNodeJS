# NodeJS-MEAN-Stack

This project follows a Udemy course entitled: [Learn and Understand NodeJS](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/)

This repository contains my work as I progress through a course designed to provide a deep understanding of Node.js. Throughout this journey, I explore how Node.js functions behind the scenes, including the C++ V8 JavaScript engine that powers it. The course covers essential topics like structuring code with modules, working with asynchronous code, the event loop, streams, and building web servers. I also delve into Express.js for creating web apps and APIs, managing npm packages, connecting to databases, and working with the MEAN stack.
